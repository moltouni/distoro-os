Project that includes it's own Two-Stage Bootloader and Kernel from wich you can learn, expand it or do both...
This was my High School Graduation Project (2012.) and I wanted to make it open. Enjoy!

Some of the main things:
	- own two stage bootloader
	- x86
	- Protected mode
	- FAT 12 filesystem
	- keyboard
	- screen
	- working PIT, PIC
	- exceptions, interrupts

======================================================
		HOW DOES IT WORK
======================================================

Project consists of two stage bootloader and kernel.

First stage of bootloader just reads disk wich is formatted as FAT12 using BIOS interrupts and loads stage2.bin.
Second stage then sets up Protected mode (Keyboard method) and loads kernel.bin.
Kernel cleans screen and outputs some welcome text, waits 5 seconds (PIT), cleans screen and gives you "input screen" (keyboard, PIC).
Kernel also has exceptions set up with interrupts for PIT and keyboard...

Script comp/create.sh creates file "disk" wich has FAT 12 filesystem on it, then it puts two stages of bootloader onto that "disk" file
	and calls comp/compileAndLink.sh wich just compiles and links all together into kernel.bin and puts it in that file.
	For testing purpuses you can run bochs emulator. Configure bochs with floppy type=1_44, 1_44="disk", status=inserted.

I've also included binaries and complete disk image ("disk") of Distoro OS if you just wan't dd-it to USB and test this thing.

Use this project as example of building simple operating system that WORKS or expand it so it can run on potatto!
Have fun!

======================================================
		BUILDING PROJECT
======================================================

Tools:
	- nasm 2.08.01
	- binutils-2.19.1
	- gcc-core-4.3.3
	- libmpc-dev
	- gmp-5.0.4
	- mpfr-3.1.0
	- bochs 2.4.5

Steps:
	1. Get tools with recommended versions (check /comp/compileAndLink.sh for paths)
	2. cd to comp/
	3. ./create.sh (Makefile?)

Peace.
